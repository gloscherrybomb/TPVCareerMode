            <h2>What is TPV Career Mode?</h2>
            <p>TPV Career Mode is a community-driven progression system for TrainingPeaks Virtual (TPV) racing. We transform individual race results into an immersive career experience where every pedal stroke counts toward your journey through the ranks of virtual cycling.</p>
            
            <p>Think of it as your virtual cycling career simulator - complete with progressive challenges, competitive standings, awards, and a vibrant peloton of AI-powered competitors who keep the racing exciting from Event 1 through to the season finale.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            
            <h3>🏁 Sequential Racing</h3>
            <p>Your career progresses one race at a time. Complete Event 1 to unlock Event 2. Master Event 2 to tackle Event 3. Each event builds on your performance, creating a genuine sense of progression and achievement.</p>
            
            <h3>📊 Performance-Based Rewards</h3>
            <p>Points aren't just handed out - they're earned through smart racing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Base Points:</strong> Position-based rewards with bonuses for podium finishes</li>
                <li><strong>Bonus Points:</strong> Beat your predicted position to earn 1-5 extra points</li>
                <li><strong>Punching Up Medal (🥊):</strong> Finish 10+ places better than predicted</li>
                <li><strong>Giant Killer Medal (⚔️):</strong> Beat the highest-rated rider in the race</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🎯 Smart Competition</h3>
            <p>Race against a diverse field of AI competitors powered by real TrainingPeaks Virtual data. These aren't just static names - they're riders with unique strengths, weaknesses, and racing styles. High-rated climbers dominate hilly courses, while sprinters excel in flat criteriums.</p>
            
            <p>Our intelligent backfilling system ensures every bot competes in every event (through simulation when needed), so the season-long standings reflect true performance, not just who showed up most often.</p>

            <h3>🏆 Comprehensive Career Tracking</h3>
            <p>Your profile page tells the complete story of your racing career:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total points and events completed</li>
                <li>Recent results with predictions and bonuses</li>
                <li>Trophy cabinet with all medals and awards</li>
                <li>Career progression and milestones</li>

            <h3>Event Variety</h3>
            <p>Season 1 features 9 carefully selected events spanning the full spectrum of virtual cycling:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>Progressive Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Events are carefully ordered to introduce challenges gradually. Early events establish your baseline, mid-season races test your development, and late-season events crown the champion.</p>
