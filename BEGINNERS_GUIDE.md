# TPV Career Mode - Beginner's Guide

Welcome to TPV Career Mode! This guide will help you understand the key features and get you started on your virtual cycling career.

## What is TPV Career Mode?

TPV Career Mode is a web-based virtual cycling career game that transforms your TrainingPeaks Virtual (TPV) race results into an immersive progression experience. Think of it as a career mode for virtual cycling - you'll advance through stages, earn awards, develop your personality as a racer, and compete against a diverse AI peloton while racing real events on TPV.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up & Link Your Account
- Visit the TPV Career Mode website and create an account
- You'll need your TPV User ID (UID) to link your race results
- Your UID can be found in your TPV profile or race results

### 2. Understanding the Season Structure
Season 1 consists of **9 stages** that you'll complete sequentially:
- **5 mandatory stages** - specific events you must complete
- **3 choice stages** - you pick from a pool of optional events (but can only use each once!)
- **1 final stage** - a special finale to cap off your season

You must complete Stage 1 to unlock Stage 2, Stage 2 to unlock Stage 3, and so on.

## Core Features
