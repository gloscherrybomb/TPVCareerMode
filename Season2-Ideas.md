# TPV Career Mode - Season 2 Brainstorming

*Generated: 2025-12-09*

## Core Season 2 Concepts

### Team Integration
- Users can select their existing TrainingPeaks Virtual team or join a new one in-game
- Teams become part of the career narrative
- Team managers "scout" you based on performance - receive contract offers with different prestige levels
- Team role dynamics: start as a domestique, earn team leadership through performance
- Team objectives in races (help teammate win vs individual glory) with morale/reputation consequences
- Mid-season transfer windows for team switching

### Team Events
- Team time trials (already supported by TPV platform)
- Team-based competitions and challenges
- Team chat/coordination during team events
- Training camps with teammates (group workouts that boost team chemistry)
- Team rivalries with ongoing storylines

### Special Multiplayer Events
- One-off human multiplayer events with multiple timeslots
- Focus on special occasions: Olympics, World Championships, etc.
- Special awards for podium finishes or wins in these events
- Events don't progress career but are recorded in lifetime stats and career history
- Multi-stage events (mini Tour de France over a weekend with 3-4 stages, cumulative time)
- Different event categories: Spring Classics, Grand Tour stages, Track Championships, Gravel races
- "Invitation only" events unlocked by hitting certain career milestones
- Live event commentary/narrative that references real-world cycling culture

## Additional Feature Ideas

### Progression & Specialization
- Specialization paths: sprinter, climber, time trialist, all-rounder (affects event invitations)
- Equipment sponsors and upgrades tied to performance
- Form/fitness system - can't peak for every event, need to plan your season
- Agent/manager system that negotiates contracts and secures special event invites

### Achievement System
- Career milestones: first podium, first win, first monument, world champion, etc.
- Special "palmares" page showing career highlights
- Unique badges/titles for special achievements (Olympic medalist, World Champion, Monument winner)
- Season-ending awards: best young rider, most aggressive, points classification
- Post-race interviews where responses affect team morale or rival relationships

### Community Features
- Community challenges: "This week, 1000 riders need to collectively climb 1 million meters"
- Rival teams - not just individual rivals, but team rivalries
- Hall of Fame with historical records from all players

### Legacy Features
- Retire your rider and start a new career with small legacy bonuses
- Retired rider could appear as an AI rival or team director in new careers
- Career comparison stats across multiple retired riders

### Strategic Elements
- Weather conditions affecting race strategy in special events
- Course reconnaissance for major events
- Injury/recovery mechanics (minor setback if racing too much)

## Notes
- Some features will need to be adapted to work with the real-world cycling/turbo trainer platform constraints
- Focus on features that enhance the narrative and progression systems while working within TPV's existing infrastructure
